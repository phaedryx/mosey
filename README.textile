h2. mosey

This is a simple, clean, straightforward colloquy theme/style.  I has variants for a dark background, ignoring events (for channels with lots of joiners/leavers), and large text.  It also has bip support.

Move mosey.colloquyStyle to ~/Library/Application Support/Colloquy/Styles/ to install.

This theme was created by Tad Thorley (phaedryx).
Bip support was added by Zach Wily (zwily).
